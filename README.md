# Recomenda

CAPSTONE PROJECT 

Project Name: Recomenda 
A web application project that uses data from a Human Resources Management System (HRMS) to provide recommendations for managers would be a sophisticated tool, combining data analysis and administrative insights. 
I chose this project because several job positions want people who do HR data analysis.

Objective:
To develop a web-based application that leverages HR data to provide managers recommendations for decisions related to remote work, leave policies, employee engagement, and other HR-related issues.

Key Features:

1. Data Integration:
    - Establish a secure connection to the existing Database to access employee data.

4. HR Analysis:

    - Key performance indicators (KPIs) like total of employees, average of age, average of salary, average of extra hours. The aim of this page is allowing the manager see the overview of the company.
