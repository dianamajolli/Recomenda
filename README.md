# Recomenda

CAPSTONE PROJECT 

Project Name: Recomenda 
A web application project that uses data from a Human Resources Management System (HRMS) to provide recommendations for managers would be a sophisticated tool, combining data analysis and administrative insights. 
I chose this project because several job positions want people who do HR data analysis.
